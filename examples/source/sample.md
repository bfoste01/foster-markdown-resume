### Profile {#profile}

I am interested in early childhood policy that utilizes a risks and protective factors frame to help boost the positively enhance the development of vulnerable populations. I am also intrigued by community data initiatives that focus on issues pertinent to early childhood policy; in particular, efforts that take operate within community coalitions. Finally, I am interested in merging my computer science skills with policy needs to develop innovative data visualizations and front-end web applications.
